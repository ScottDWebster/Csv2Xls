# Csv2Xls
Simple perl CSV file to excel spreadsheet converter.

I created this to get around Excel's habit of removing leading whitespace from fields containing only digits when importing data from a 
CSV file.

The final product is the csv2xls2excelOLE.pl script.  This will convert the file and then use OLE to open it in Excel.
